# Restore-SQL
Powershell Automation Script that checks for an existing SQL DB and if it doesn't exist then it restores it with backup data. The backup data file needs to be in the same directory as the script. You may change certain information in this script depending on your needs.

NOTE: There are 3 .sql files included which are dependencies for the script to work.  The 3rd dependency "Client_A_Contacts.sql" calls an existing backup .csv file from within the same directory.  If you are using this for your own implementation, you may need to change some pathing in the .sql file and .csv file as well as rename them according to suit your needs.

This PowerShell script performs a series of actions related to Microsoft SQL Server database management. Here's a comprehensive explanation of what each part of the script does:

1 - Check for Database Existence: The script first checks if a database named "ClientDB" exists on the SQL Server instance named ".\SQLEXPRESS". It uses a SQL query to count the number of databases with the specified name. If the count is greater than zero, it means the database exists.

2 - Delete Existing Database (if applicable): If the database exists, the script attempts to delete it using the DROP DATABASE SQL command. It catches any errors that occur during the deletion process and displays an error message.

3 - Create New Database: Regardless of whether the database existed previously, the script proceeds to create a new database named "ClientDB" using the CREATE DATABASE SQL command.

4 - Import Data into Database: After creating the database, the script imports data into it. It invokes the Invoke-Sqlcmd cmdlet to execute SQL scripts that create tables and import data. The script expects the SQL scripts to be present in the same directory as the PowerShell script.

5 - Generate Output File: Finally, the script executes a SQL query to select all records from the "Client_A_Contacts" table within the "ClientDB" database. The query results are redirected to a text file named "SqlResults.txt" located in the same directory as the PowerShell script.

6 - Exception Handling: The entire script is enclosed within a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during execution. If an error occurs, it is caught by the catch block, and an error message is displayed to the console.

Overall, this script automates the process of managing a SQL Server database, including checking for existence, deleting if necessary, creating a new database, importing data, and generating an output file with query results.
